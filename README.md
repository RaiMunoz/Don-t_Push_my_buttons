# Don-t_Push_my_buttons
Don't Push my buttons is a project previously done in the MAKECU 2015 hackathon. 

# Materials
Under the group under_construction, we used:
-an arduino uno 
-5 push pins 
-a glove
-an HC06 bluetooth module

The project is designed to assist the hearing-impaired to successfully communicate with others who are not adept in American Sign Langugage in any location using the glove. We ran the file using the keyoled.ino script provided. Happy Hacking!
